# PyLorenz
Lorenz Machine Simulation Using Python

## Synopsis

This is a Python representation of the Lorenz Chipher, used by the Germans in WWII.
More information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher

## Motivation

After recently starting learning Python, I thought this would be a good program to try as an introductory program.

## Installation

Simply run main.py.

## Usage

Hopefully the program menu is concise enough, however the program allows you to;
* Encrypt/Decrypt using the Lorenz Cipher, with the option to see the verbose version.
* Change the starting positions of any of the wheels.

## Future Additions:
* Reading in different pin settings, depending on the day.
* Read from, and write to file.
